    <p>Hello! I'm Jethro Lagmay, but most people call me Jupiter or Jupi for short. I study at CIIT College of Arts and Technology, and currently I am taking a Bachelor's degree for Computer Science. <br> <br>
    
    I enjoy photography, playing music, dancing, sketching, and many others, and of course, I enjoy coding, and developing websites and applications. It is my dream job after all. <br> <br>

    This website is a sure way to get to know me so continue reading and check out some of my work and you'll find that I'm more than just what meets the eye. Thank you and have a great day!
    </p>
